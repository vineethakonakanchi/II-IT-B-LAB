EXPERIMENT 3:

Normalization: The process of decomposing relations that contain anomalies (insertion,Updation,Deletion anomalies) to produce smaller well structured relations, to reduce data redundancy.

Normal Form: A state of a relation that results from applying simple rules regarding functional dependencies to that relation.

Functional Dependencies: A functional dependency is a constraint between two attributes or two sets of attributes. A functional dependency of B on A represented by an arrow A->B

Eg: Bus no->Bname, Type

The types of normal forms:

1st Normal Form: A relation in the 1st normal form if it contains no multi valued attributes.

2nd Normal Form : A relation is in 2nd normal form if it is in 1st normal form and every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
Partial Dependency is functional dependencies in which one or more non-key attributes are functionally depends on part of the primary key.

3rd Normal Form : A relation is in 3rd normal form if it is in 2nd normal form and no transitive dependency exists.
Transitive dependency in a relation is a functional dependency between two (or more) non-key attributes.

Boyce Codd Normal Form: A relation in a Boyce Codd normal form iff every determinant in the relation is a candidate key.it is strict version of 3NF,so also called 3.5NF

4th Normal Form : When a relation is in BCNF there are no longer any anomalies that result from functional dependency.it comes from concept of Multivalued dependency.

Eg: 1st Normal Form:

PNR no Pname Age Gender 		Addr 					 Phno
457    Satish 		28 M 		Plot No. 5 RK. Puram, Hyd   		9008745625,9959678987
746    Sheela		 25 F 		H.No:1-9-88,DilsukhNagar,Hyderabad 9000998683

Multivalued attributes are normalized into single value attributes.

PNR no Pname Age Gender Addr 					Phno
457 	Satish 	27 M 	Plot No. 5 RK. Puram, Hyderabad	 9008745625
457 	Satish	 27 M	Plot No. 5 RK. Puram, Hyderabad 	    9959678987
746	Sheela	25 F 	H.No:1-9-88,DilsukhNagar,Hyderabad 	9000998683




Eg: 2nd Normal Form:

PNR no Pname Age Gender Addr 				Phno
457 	Satish 	27 	MPlot No. 5 RK. Puram, Hyderabad	 9008745625
457	 Satish 27	 M	 Plot No. 5 RK. Puram, Hyderabad 	 9008745625
746 	Sheela 25 	F	 H.No:1-9-88,DilsukhNagar,Hyderabad 9000998683

PNR no is the only primary key .so the partial dependency is as follows:
PNR no -> Pname, Age, Gender
PNR no -> Addr, Phno

PNR no Pname Age Gender
457 	Satish 	27M
746 	Sheela	 25 F

PNR no	 Addr					 Phno
457 	Plot No. 5 RK. Puram, Hyderabad 	     9008745625
746 	H.No:1-9-88,DilsukhNagar,Hyderabad    9000998683
