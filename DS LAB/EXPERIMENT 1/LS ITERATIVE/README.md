# LINEAR SEARCH ITERATIVE

## AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT : To find the key value using iterative linear search.
 
### DESCRIPTION : In linear search algorithm, we compare targeted element with each element of the array. If the element is found then its position is displayed. Itâ€™s best case is o(1) and the worst case is o(n).

#### step by step procedure :

1.Linear search matches every element with the key value. hence it is called sequential search.

( Note :- array may or may not be sorted)

2.the search continues till the element is found.

3.If the key value matches with the element, then position of the element is displayed.

4.If the element is not found, then it gives the return value -1 which means given key value is not in the list or array.

# OUTPUT 1 given array 4,7,9,11,15,16,21,31,67,98

 key value (15) - the key value is 15, it is found in the position 4
 
 # OUTPUT 2 
 key value (99) - the key value is not found in the givven array, so it returns index -1.
