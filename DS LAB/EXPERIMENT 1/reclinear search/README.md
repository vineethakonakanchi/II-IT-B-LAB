# LINEAR SEARCH WITH RECURSION
## AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT : to find the element in the given array using linear search with recursion
### DESCRIPTION : algorithm for linear search is written to find if the element is in the array. if the element is in the array then we have to find the position of the element. 
#### step by step procedure :-
1.1.Linear search matches every element with the key value. hence it is called sequential search. 

( Note :- array may or may not be sorted)

2.the search continues till the element is found. Passing array, key and size to the recursive function recursiveLinearSearch(int array[],int key, int size)

3.If the key value matches with the element, then position of the element is displayed.

4.If the element is not found, then it gives the return value -1 which means given key value is not in the list or array.
