LINEAR SEARCH
In linear search algorithm, we compare targeted element with each element of the array. If the element is found then its position is displayed. It’s best case is o(1) and the worst case is o(n).
1.Linear search matches every element with the key value. hence it is called sequential search.
( Note :- array may or may not be sorted)
2.the search continues till the element is found.
3.If the key value matches with the element, then position of the element is displayed.
4.If the element is not found, then it gives the return value -1 which means given key value is not in the list or array.

For example – given array (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
                               Key value is 6
•	Start form the left of the array, index starts with 0.
•	Linear search searches for the element starting from 1.
•	6 ≠ 1 , then the search moves further.
•	This continues till the 6 = 6.
•	6 = 6 at position 5, now the search stops
•	“6 is found at the position 5” is displayed.
